### 📂 `notes/` — Learning Resources

This folder contains **books, PDFs, reference links, cheat sheets**, and any material shared during sessions. Check this folder regularly — new resources will be added as we progress through each stage.

### 📂 `submissions/` — Your Assignments

This is where **you** submit your work. Each student creates their **own folder** inside `submissions/` and uploads assignments there.

---

## 📝 How to Submit Your Work (Step-by-Step Guide)

> ⚠️ **Read every step carefully.** Do NOT skip anything. If you get stuck, ask for help — that's what learning is about!

### Step 0: Install Git (One-Time Setup)

If you haven't installed Git yet:
- **Windows:** Download from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/) and install (keep all defaults)
- **Mac:** Open Terminal and type `git --version` (it will prompt you to install if needed)
- **Linux:** Run `sudo apt install git`

Configure your identity (run these once):
```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your_email@example.com"
```

### Step 1: Fork This Repository

1. Click the **"Fork"** button at the top-right corner of this page
2. This creates your own copy of the repository on your GitHub account

### Step 2: Clone Your Forked Repository

Open your terminal (Command Prompt / Git Bash / Terminal) and run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/ai-adventure.git
```

> 🔁 Replace `YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME` with your actual GitHub username.

### Step 3: Navigate Into the Project

```bash
cd ai-adventure
```

### Step 4: Go to the Submissions Folder

```bash
cd submissions
```

### Step 5: Create Your Personal Folder

Create a folder using this **exact naming convention**:

```
FirstName_LastName_RollNumber
```

**Rules for folder naming:**
- Use **PascalCase** (first letter of each word capitalized)
- Separate Name and Roll Number with an **underscore** `_`
- **No spaces**, no special characters, no emojis in folder names

✅ **Correct Examples:**
```
Rahul_Kumar_B230001
Priya_Sharma_B230045
Mohammed_Ali_B230112
```

❌ **Wrong Examples:**
```
rahul kumar b230001     ← has spaces, no underscores, no capitals
RAHUL_KUMAR_b230001     ← ALL CAPS is not PascalCase
rahul-kumar-B230001     ← hyphens instead of underscores
Rahul Kumar_B230001     ← space in name
```

Create the folder:
```bash
mkdir FirstName_LastName_RollNumber
```

Example:
```bash
mkdir Rahul_Kumar_B230001
```

### Step 6: Add Your Assignment File

Navigate into your folder and add your work:

```bash
cd Rahul_Kumar_B230001
```

You can create a file directly from the terminal:
```bash
echo "This is my first assignment!" > assignment1.txt
```

Or simply copy/paste your assignment file into this folder using your file explorer.

### Step 7: Stage Your Changes

Go back to the root of the project:
```bash
cd ../..
```

Now tell Git to track your new files:
```bash
git add .
```

> 💡 `git add .` stages **all** new and changed files. You can also add specific files: `git add submissions/Rahul_Kumar_B230001/assignment1.txt`

### Step 8: Commit Your Changes

```bash
git commit -m "Add assignment 1 - Rahul Kumar B230001"
```

> 💡 The commit message should be short and descriptive. Always include your name and roll number.

### Step 9: Push to Your Fork

```bash
git push origin main
```

> This uploads your work to **your** GitHub fork.

### Step 10 (Optional): Create a Pull Request

1. Go to **your forked repo** on GitHub
2. Click **"Contribute"** → **"Open Pull Request"**
3. Add a title like: `Submission: Rahul Kumar B230001 - Assignment 1`
4. Click **"Create Pull Request"**

> 🎓 A Pull Request (PR) is how you propose your changes to the main repository. The trainer will review and merge it.

## ⚠️ Rules — Read This Carefully!

> Breaking these rules may result in your submission being rejected.

### 📌 Rule 1: Stay in Your Folder
- **Only** add/edit files inside `submissions/YourName_RollNumber/`
- Do **NOT** touch the `notes/` folder, `README.md`, or anyone else's folder

### 📌 Rule 2: Follow the Naming Convention
- Folder name must be: `FirstName_LastName_RollNumber`
- Use **PascalCase** with **underscores**
- Double-check before creating — renaming later causes unnecessary complications

### 📌 Rule 3: Do Not Edit Others' Work
- Never modify, delete, or copy files from another student's folder
- This is a trust-based system — respect your peers' work

### 📌 Rule 4: Write Meaningful Commit Messages
- Bad: `git commit -m "update"`
- Good: `git commit -m "Add assignment 1 - Priya Sharma B230045"`

### 📌 Rule 5: Ask Before You Guess
- Stuck? Ask the trainer or a peer
- It's better to ask a "silly" question than to break the repo
